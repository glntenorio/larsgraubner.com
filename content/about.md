My name is Lars Graubner. I'm a 25 years old Front-end developer from Germany 🇩🇪. The endless possibilities of the web excite me. I learning new things every day and always try to catch up with new technology.

I love working with JavaScript, especially ECMAScript 2015, which brings alot of new useful features. I'm trying to write well architectured applications with great user experience. For this task React comes into place often as it's modular approach fits my needs in many cases and let's me split up complex code into small chunks.

You can find several projects of mine on [Github](http://github.com/lgraubner) where I'm also contributing to some open source projects.

When not fiddling around with code I'm spending my time with my beloved wife, our son and our dog 🐶. If I find some spare time I do strength training 💪 or hack around with the Raspberry Pi. My favorite animals are monkeys. 🐒
