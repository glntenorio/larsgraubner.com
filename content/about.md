My name is Lars Graubner. I&#8217;m a 24 years old front-end developer from Germany. The endless possibilities of the web excite me. I love learning new things every day, so I always try to catch up with the latest trends.

Mainly I&#8217;m working with JavaScript. It can be a great programming language if used right. I&#8217;m trying to write well architectured applications with great user experience. For this task React comes into place often as it&#8217;s modular approach fits my needs in many cases and let&#8217;s me split up complex code into small chunks.

You can find several projects of mine on [Github](http://github.com/lgraubner) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~graubnla) where I&#8217;m also contributing to some open source projects.

Currently I&#8217;m working at LeadFisher, a small multi product startup working with WordPress and big Databases.

## Trivia

After work I do all kind of activities with my beloved wife and our dog &#8220;Bolle&#8221; 🐶. If I find some spare time I do strength training 💪 or hack around with the Raspberry Pi. I also play actively in the local table soccer league. My favorite animals are monkeys. 🐒
